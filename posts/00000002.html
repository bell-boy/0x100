<p>Hi again! This week was kind of busy, yet kind of chill. Lets recap.</p>


<ul><li>Kinda fumbled on my goals</li><li>Added a couple of features to bytecode</li><li>Spent some time in MIT's Deep Learning course</li></ul>


<h2>Last Weeks Goals</h2>


<ul><li>I was <strong>NOT</strong> able to find a good bio text book, this is really important as I paid for that (expensive) AP exam.</li><li>I did not train a model using MLPack.</li><li>I (kind of) solved a cp problem per day.</li><li>I did not start a kaggle competition.</li><li>I was not able to make a commit per day. </li></ul>


<p>So what did I do?</p>


<p>I applied to college lol. </p>


<p>But the goals I set in the previous post are kind of unrealistic. I don't feel bad for being over ambitious. I would much rather reign in my goals then finish a month thinking that I could've done more. So here's 2024, rewritten.</p>


<ul><li><a href="https://www.matsprogram.org/">SERI MATS</a></li><li><a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer Of Code</a></li><li>Reach Candiate Master on Codeforces</li><li>Gain 30 lbs</li><li>Get into an REU or Quant diversity program</li><li>Build 4 projects throughout the year</li><li>Commit code daily</li><li>Finish 12 different non-fiction books </li><li>Get a 5 on all my AP exams</li></ul>


<p>All of the motivations for these goals were explained in the <a href="https://bell-boy.github.io/0x100/posts/00000001.html">last</a> post.</p>


<p>Continuing on, here's January, rewritten.</p>


<ul><li>Complete Half of MIT's intro to Machine Learning course (yearly goals 1, 2, & 5)</li><li>Complete a CP problem a day (yearly goal 3)</li><li>Participate in a contest per week (yearly goal 3)</li><li>Gain 4lbs (yearly goal 4)</li><li>Participate in a kaggle competition. (yearly goal 6)</li><li><em>Try</em> to read a paper per day, but optimize for understanding (yearly goals 1 & 5)</li><li>Read <em>superforcasting</em> (yearly goal 7)</li><li>Read (but not necessarily finish yet) <em>Linear Algebra Done Right</em> (yearly goals 1, 2, & 5)</li><li>Get through half of MIT bio (yearly goal 8)</li><li>Tutor on schoolhouse.world (just for fun :P)</li></ul>


<p>finally, this week!</p>


<ul><li>Work on MIT machine learning at least 3 times per week</li><li>Get tutor certified on schoolhouse.world</li><li>Try to finish the weights section of mech interp lit review</li><li>decide on model architecture for kaggle comp.</li><li>Practice AP Comp Sci Exam</li></ul>


<p>Most of the goals of the form <em>do x (weekly, daily, monthly)</em> are just going to be melded into my routine as I experiment more. We'll see.</p>


<h2>bytecode!</h2>


<p>THANK GOD FOR TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT!</p>


<p>But seriously, I don't even understand how a project is even possible without TDD. I implemented a couple of new features this week and in the process SOOOO many things broke that I wouldn't have caught without my tests. Seriously thinking of switching to a new testing framework. </p>


<p>If you don't know, Test Driven Development is the process of writing tests that validate your code <em>before writing your code</em>. Then write the bare minimum code that works and passes your tests, then refactor and clean up your code! </p>


<p>It's real strength was shown off after I'd accumulated a library of tests. If I wrote code that broke old code, my tests would catch it, I didn't even have to stress!</p>


<p>Going on to new features, I added in</p>
<ul><li>Unordered lists</li><li>Links</li><li>Escape characters</li><li>A central post listing</li></ul>


<p>Of these four features ESCAPE CHARACTERS were the trickiest to implement. It was hard to do so in a way that didn't nuke all other functionality, so my code is currently a mess. </p>


<p>Links are strange because instead of following the * &lt;-- open tag |content| --&gt; * format, they're really two tags. Links look like this [text](hyperlink), this is super annoying and I had to implement a solution I felt less than comfortable with. I'm thinking of getting my code reviewed on reddit to try and improve my solutions to these less obvious cases.</p>


<h2>MIT Machine Learning</h2>


<p><em><a href="https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/">This</a> is the course I'll be referring to</em></p>


<p>So week one was just a more general review of everything I'd learned over these past couple of weeks I've spent with ML. Linear algebra, tensor manipulation in python etc. The actual content started of with <em>Linear Classifiers</em>. A pretty basic ML model that can easily be perfectly optimized. In short, it's just a plane through an arbitrarily high dimensional space. Points are scattered through out the space, and what we learn is a plane that separates classes. A 1-D example would be a classifier trying to figure out if you're above a certain height by looking at the length of your femur. If your femur lies on a line above the LC, then you're over the height we trained for, if not, you're under! They go into a lot more mathematical detail that I'm still trying to understand myself. I'll let you know how it goes.</p>
