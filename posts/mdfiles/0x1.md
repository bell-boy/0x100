Happy new year! If you're reading this, I finally got the markdown transpiler to work. This blog is going to be a bit more basic than I would've otherwise liked. Still haven't gotten around to implementing a couple key features (most noticably lists), but that's a problem for next week.

A lot happened this week and a lot more is to come, but if you're feeling lazy...

I (tried) to implement a transformer

I learned a lot about programming langauges by making bytecode (my name for the markdown transpiler I use)

I figured out what I want 2024 (and beyond) to look like.
