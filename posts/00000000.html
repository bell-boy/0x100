                <p>I'm writing this first blog post by hand. "By hand" here means writing the raw code for this blog myself, though I hope to have that automated before 2024.<p>
                <p>I wanted to talk a little about why I started this, and what I want to do with it. But if you're impatient, here are the spark notes.<p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Get better at programming (especially web-dev) in general</li>
                    <li>Have a portfolio website</li>
                    <li>Get better at writing/Becoming more data driven</li>
                    <li><s>Have another project for my mit maker portfolio</s></li>
                </ol>
                <h2>becoming a better developer</h2>
                <p>I'm obsessed with CS, I have been since I was a kid. When I was 12 I had this huge library of (mostly unfinihsed) games that I wasn't really proud of. Fast forward 5 years, I have this huge library of competative programming problems with not much else to show for it. I've spent plenty of time in vim and vscode, but I wouldn't call myself that good of a programmer. I don't think I can use CS to make anything anyone actually cares about right now. This blog is a way of making up for that.</p>
                <p>I want to focus on projects that are more substantive. Projects that either A: force me to learn a new subset of theory or new techonolgy or B: have a real practical use for me or other people. Additionally, I want to explore some form of hardware this year.</p>
                <p>I want to make 4 projects in 2024, (i'll count this as a project lol). For each project, I want it's scope to be large enough that it'll take me a couple of months to complete. A signifcant portion of these weekly blog posts will probably be me talking about progress on some project. So <a href="">0x100</a> pulls double duty. It satisfies condition A while letting me detail and describe all future projects, long with their goals.</p>
                <h3>0x100</h3>
                <p>Before I move on, I'm going to describe in more detail the specific technical goals I have for 0x100. Here's a short summary.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Figure out how the hell i'm supposed to organize web development projects</li>
                    <li>Understand why react is needed</li>
                    <li>Practice using bootstrap as intended</li>
                    <li>Build my own markdown transpiler</li>
                    <li>Practice writing non-fucked maintable code in general</li>
                </ol>
                <p>My web development experience in general has been pretty fucked. It feels like there's a million ways to do anything and everything. Anything I write more complicated than a todo app seems to have a gorillion moving parts, held together by tape and glue. For instance, look at <a href="https://github.com/bell-boy/hive-web">hive</a>, an app I made for my district's <a href="https://www.congressionalappchallenge.us/">Congressional App Challenge</a>. I used react, bootstrap, and firebase to write the whole thing and I barely understood what I was doing.</p>
                <p>The only reason I decided to use react and firebase was because that's what "real developers" used. React felt like overkill constantly. I didn't understand the motivation behind any of the architectual choices of the framework, and god forbid you ask me what an effect is. Without firebase I would've been totally fried. There was no way I could've navigated running a backend while also figuring out how to weild the greatsword that is react.</p>
                <p>Bootstrap was the only decision that kind of made sense. I stared using Bootstrap after an attempt to use pure CSS resulted in a shitstorm I was not prepared for. Unlike the other two frameworks I used, I felt like I understood why Boostrap existed, and what problems it solved. Don't get me wrong, the way I used Bootstrap was fucked, but I understand <em>why</em> it's fucked.</p>
                <p>So this project is a way to address these issues. The only framework I'm using to write 0x100 is Bootstrap 5.3. Everything else is pure HTML and JS, with a couple of automation features (and the markdown transpiler) written in python. I'll be hosting this on github pages (because i'm broke) and working around those limitations. Hopefully the experience is painful enough to motivate the use of react/other frameworks.</p>
                <h2>Becoming a Better Person</h2>
                <p>I've been reading a lot of blog style media recently like <a href="https://www.astralcodexten.com/">Astal Codex Ten</a> and <a href="https://lesswrong.com/">LessWrong</a>, which has opened my eyes to the value of good writing. Writing kind of forces you to clarify your thoughts. You're pulling them from the ether of your mind into reality, and once they're out, you can't control how others may percieve them.</p>
                <p>I've noticed that I'm incapable for following through on on any sort of long term plan (i.e. 6 months) because even if I write up the plan, I forget the plan exits maybe just two weeks later. Being forced to write a weekly post reflecting on the past week seems like a great way to commit to goals. We'll see how it goes.</p>
                <h3>a little about the name</h3>
                <p>0x100 is the hex representation of 256. Which is the number of weeks I want to write 0x100 for. Assuming that I follow the strict schedule of a post every monday, post 256 will go live Tuesday, November 21, 2028. Which is around thanksgiving break of my senior year at college. I figure I would've grown and changed a lot by then, and maybe i'll look back on this post and laugh. Hopefully i'll look back and see how far i've grown.</p>
